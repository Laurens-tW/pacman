Double Trouble

This team consists of two agents that act very similarly.
They both start out acting defensively, until the first invader is killed.
Then they begin acting offensively, eating pellets and bringing them back until a threshold is reached,
after which they stay defensive.

Only the default libraries delivered with the task were used:
- random
- util
- capture_agents/CaptureAgent
- game/Directions
- util/nearest_point

To start a game against the baseline team, use the following command:

    python capture.py -r agents/team_name_1/my_team.py -b baseline_team
